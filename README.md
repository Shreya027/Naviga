# Navigate a Terrain
Built during E-yantra IIT-Bombay All India Robotics Competition. Leader follower system in which a Spotter guides a Rover through a maze with check-points. The image of a maze is processed using OpenCV and NumPy to calculate the optimum path. This path is sent to the Spotter which directs the Rover using a laser beam .LED blinking at different coloured checkpoints is used to show acknowledgement between them. Raspberry Pi 1 is used for the Rover and Node MCU is used for the Spotter. It uses Socket Programming for communication between the two bots.
